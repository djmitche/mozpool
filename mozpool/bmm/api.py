    This class represents a common access point for all BMM operations.

    Each operation is represented as an AsyncOperation instance, meaning that
    it can be called asynchronously as `api.operation.start(callback,
    ..args..)` or synchronously as `api.operation.run(..args..)`.

    The asynchronous invocation returns immediately, and will invoke CALLBACK
    with the result when the operation is complete, or not at all if the
    operation fails or takes longer than the configured time.
    CALLBACK will be invoked in a different thread from
    that where this function was called.

    The synchronous invocation is similar to the asynchronous invocation, but
    blocks until the operation is complete, raising TimeoutError if that takes
    too long.
